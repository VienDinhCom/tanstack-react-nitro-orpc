# Modern MERN Stack Replacement

A modern MERN replacement designed for ultra-cheap, zero-ops deployment on Cloudflare—powered by
[ESMate](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate), React, Nitro, Cloudflare Workers, oRPC type-safe APIs, Drizzle ORM,
Cloudflare D1, Better Auth, TanStack Router, and elegant shadcn/ui components.

Everything you need to ship production-ready apps.

## 🚀 Everything You Need

A carefully curated stack of modern technologies that work perfectly together.

### 🎨 Frontend Excellence

Built with **Vite**, **React**, and **TanStack Router** for a blazing-fast, type-safe single page application
experience. Styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for modern, accessible interfaces.

### 🔋 Backend Power

Powered by **Nitro** for universal deployment and **oRPC** for end-to-end type safety. Includes **Drizzle ORM** for
database management and **Better Auth** for a complete authentication solution.

### 🛠️ Developer Experience

Includes [ESMate](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate), a modern task runner and CLI that streamlines project
management, automates formatting, and enhances your development workflow.

## 🎮 Demonstration

### ☑️ Todo App

A complete CRUD application demonstrating oRPC mutations, optimistic updates, and real-time state management with
TanStack Query.

### 💬 Real-time Chat

A live chat room showcasing oRPC subscriptions (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates, message persistence, and
multi-user communication.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

This project is generated by the
[ESMate React Nitro](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate/tree/main/templates/react-nitro) template, providing a
comprehensive and pre-configured foundation for building modern, type-safe full-stack applications with ease.

### Installation

1.  **Create a new project:**

    ```bash
    npx create-esmate --template react-nitro
    ```

    Change into the new project directory:

    ```bash
    cd [new-project-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file by copying the `sample.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

4.  **Configure Cloudflare**

    ```bash
    npx wrangler login
    ```

    Then configure `wrangler.json` with your worker and database information.

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    This will run migrations and start the development server. Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) (or
    the port shown in your terminal) to see the result.

## 📦 Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev`: Runs database migrations and starts the Nitro + Vite development environment.
- `pnpm run build`: Performs type checking and creates a production build.
- `pnpm run start`: Previews the production build locally.
- `pnpm run deploy`: Deploys the production build to the cloud.

## 🌍 Why Cloudflare?

Deploying on Cloudflare Workers and D1 provides a robust, cost-effective infrastructure for modern applications:

- **Zero-Ops Scaling:** Automatically scales from zero to global traffic without manual server management.
- **Global Edge Performance:** Your application runs in 300+ cities worldwide, delivering sub-100ms latency to users
  globally.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Leverage a generous free tier and a pay-as-you-go model that is significantly cheaper than
  traditional cloud providers.
- **Integrated Data:** Cloudflare D1 offers a native, serverless SQL database designed to work seamlessly with Workers.
- **Fast Development Cycle:** With `wrangler`, you can preview and deploy changes to the global network in seconds.
